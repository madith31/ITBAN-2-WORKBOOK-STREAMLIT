# ITBAN-2-WORKBOOK-STREAMLIT

IV. Fetch and Display API Data

This task connects the Streamlit app to an external API to fetch and display live data. In this example, the OpenWeatherMap API is used to get real-time weather details for a user-specified city. The results are parsed from JSON and shown using basic Streamlit widgets and a line chart.
