# ITBAN-2-WORKBOOK-STREAMLIT

I. Hello, Streamlit

This task introduces the basic components of a Streamlit app. The app uses text input fields and number input fields to collect data from the user, then displays a personalized message based on the input. This helps users become familiar with st.title, st.header, st.write, and input functions like st.text_input and st.number_input. 

II. DataFrame Viewer

This task demonstrates how to load and display tabular data from a CSV file using Streamlit. It uses st.file_uploader to upload a file, pandas to read the data, and widgets like st.checkbox and st.selectbox to allow users to view raw data and filter it based on a specific column. This provides interactive data exploration capabilities.

III. Slidebar and Layout

This task focuses on organizing Streamlit app content using layout tools such as st.sidebar, st.columns, st.expander, and st.tabs. These components help create a more structured and user-friendly interface, allowing users to filter data and navigate between different views efficiently.
