# ITBAN-2-WORKBOOK-STREAMLIT

I. Hello, Streamlit

  This task introduces the basic components of a Streamlit app. The app uses text input fields and number input fields to collect data from the user, then displays a personalized message based on the input. This helps users become familiar with st.title, st.header, st.write, and input functions like st.text_input and st.number_input.

II. DataFrame Viewer

This task demonstrates how to load and display tabular data from a CSV file using Streamlit. It uses st.file_uploader to upload a file, pandas to read the data, and widgets like st.checkbox and st.selectbox to allow users to view raw data and filter it based on a specific column. This provides interactive data exploration capabilities.

III. Slidebar and Layout

This task focuses on organizing Streamlit app content using layout tools such as st.sidebar, st.columns, st.expander, and st.tabs. These components help create a more structured and user-friendly interface, allowing users to filter data and navigate between different views efficiently.

IV. Fetch and Display API Data

This task connects the Streamlit app to an external API to fetch and display live data. In this example, the OpenWeatherMap API is used to get real-time weather details for a user-specified city. The results are parsed from JSON and shown using basic Streamlit widgets and a line chart.

V. Data Pipeline with Database

This task demonstrates how to integrate Streamlit with a local SQLite database. Users can input student information into a form, which is then saved to the database. The app also retrieves and displays all student records dynamically using pandas.

VI. Real Time Video Stream with CV

This task explores different ways to visualize data in Streamlit using Matplotlib, Altair, and built-in chart functions like st.area_chart. It demonstrates how to plot bar charts, line charts, and area charts to display sales trends across different products.
