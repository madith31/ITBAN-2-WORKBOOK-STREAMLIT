# ITBAN-2-WORKBOOK-STREAMLIT

II. DataFrame Viewer

This task demonstrates how to load and display tabular data from a CSV file using Streamlit. It uses st.file_uploader to upload a file, pandas to read the data, and widgets like st.checkbox and st.selectbox to allow users to view raw data and filter it based on a specific column. This provides interactive data exploration capabilities.
