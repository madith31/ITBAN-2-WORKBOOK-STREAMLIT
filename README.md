# ITBAN-2-WORKBOOK-STREAMLIT

I. Hello, Streamlit

This task introduces the basic components of a Streamlit app. The app uses text input fields and number input fields to collect data from the user, then displays a personalized message based on the input. This helps users become familiar with st.title, st.header, st.write, and input functions like st.text_input and st.number_input. 

II. DataFrame Viewer

This task demonstrates how to load and display tabular data from a CSV file using Streamlit. It uses st.file_uploader to upload a file, pandas to read the data, and widgets like st.checkbox and st.selectbox to allow users to view raw data and filter it based on a specific column. This provides interactive data exploration capabilities.
